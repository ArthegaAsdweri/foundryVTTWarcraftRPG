Draenei who succumb to fel magic form the ranks of the Eredar, the greatest generals of the Burning Legion, while draenei who serve the Holy Light are immortal crusaders for justice across the cosmos.",

                "Appearance" : "As befitting their Eredar heritage, Draenei have hooved feet, tendrils that grow from the neck and short tails, and their skin color is affected by the magic they naturally absorb (with fel magic reddening them, holy magic rendering their skins blue to violet, and void magic darkening them to brown). Males' skulls are rigid (giving the appearance of a bone plate under their skin), while females grow foot-long, graceful curved horns. Broken draenei look distinctly different from normal Draenei, having flat, noseless faces and having thick, three-fingered hands, and lose their bone-like plates.",

They, like most of the orcs, fell prey to the demons' sinister influence and were changed by the corruption. Though they lost some of their former powers, the Broken still present a clear danger to all races through Outland. The largest known faction of Broken in Outland, the Ashtongue Deathsworn, is currently led by Akama. They are supposedly allied with Illidan Stormrage.",

Although understandable of those broken who remain corrupted or in service to the Legion, one would think that the unbroken would be willing to welcome any of their people that survived the orcs' genocide. Most broken are independent as a result, although the Prophet Velen, the leader of the unbroken, does extend a hand to broken to help them find their way back."

Living out the last centuries in exile and escape from the Burning Legion, the Draenei are steadfast champions of the Light, and will do anything in their power to prevent another world from falling to the Flame.",

Male dwarves tend to have long hair, and beards or facial hair often tied in ornate braids.
