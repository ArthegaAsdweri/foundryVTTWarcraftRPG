    "WC5E.Race.DraeneiDescription" : "The draenei are a powerfully-build alien race that originates from Argus. They are powerfully magically-attuned, and have the potential for exceptional good or evil. Draenei who succumb to fel magic form the ranks of the Eredar, the greatest generals of the Burning Legion, while draenei who serve the Holy Light are immortal crusaders for justice across the cosmos."
